File: README.md
Line: 265 to 269
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In README.md around lines 265 to 269 there are unresolved git conflict markers (>>>>>> main) leaving both "- Model: Uses GLM-4.6 via custom Factory.ai configuration" and "# Test change for workflow" present; remove the conflict markers and decide which content to keep—keep the documentation line about the model and delete the test-change heading (or if you prefer, merge them into a single coherent sentence), then save the file and ensure no conflict markers remain before committing.



============================================================================
File: droid-code-review.yaml
Line: 1 to 3
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In droid-code-review.yaml around lines 1 to 3, the workflow name "Droid Code Review - GLM46 Fixed" is inconsistent with variants and causes confusion; update the primary workflow name to a clear canonical identifier such as "Droid Code Review" or "Droid Code Review - GLM4.6" and rename any backup/archived copies to include a suffix like "- Backup" or "- Archived" so the authoritative workflow is obvious and backups are clearly labeled.



============================================================================
File: droid-code-review.yaml
Line: 122 to 130
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In droid-code-review.yaml around lines 122 to 130, the "Check API keys" step must enforce presence of both FACTORY_API_KEY and MODEL_API_KEY (to match droid-code-review-new.yaml and droid-code-review-backup.yaml and the merge-conflict note about GLM-4.6), so update the step to validate both variables and fail the job when either is missing (exit with non-zero), and ensure the error message clearly states which key(s) are missing.



============================================================================
File: template-repo/README.md
Line: 19
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In template-repo/README.md around line 19, the DROID_INSTALLER_SHA256 value is hardcoded without guidance on maintenance; update the README to add a short note after that line explaining that the SHA256 may change and instruct users how to retrieve the current hash (for example: point to the official installer release page or provide the exact verification command to compute or fetch the hash), and recommend updating the template whenever the installer is updated.



============================================================================
File: auto-setup-all.sh
Line: 95 to 115
Type: refactor_suggestion

Prompt for AI Agent:
In auto-setup-all.sh around lines 95 to 115, the loop processes repositories but doesn't track per-repo success/failure or report counts; add two counters (success and failed) initialized before the loop, ensure setup_repo returns a proper exit status (0 on success, non‑zero on failure), update the loop to call setup_repo and increment success or failed based on its return value, and finally update the final summary to print the counts and total repositories processed so users can see actual success/failure numbers.



============================================================================
File: AGENTS.md
Line: 47 to 49
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In AGENTS.md around lines 47 to 49, there's a duplicated "## Table of Contents" header; remove the extra header so only a single "## Table of Contents" remains, ensuring any following TOC links stay directly below the single header and adjust surrounding whitespace so formatting is consistent.



============================================================================
File: template-repo/.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml
Line: 315 to 319
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In template-repo/.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml around lines 315 to 319, after generating files.json with jq add an explicit validation that files.json exists and contains entries; if the file is missing, empty, or has zero-length JSON array, log a clear error message and exit non-zero (or remove files.json and exit) so downstream steps don't run on a missing/empty file. Use jq to check length and the shell -s test to verify file presence/size, and ensure the workflow step fails fast with an informative message when validation fails.



============================================================================
File: setup-new-repo.sh
Line: 36
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In setup-new-repo.sh around line 36, the git clone call can hang indefinitely if the network stalls; wrap the clone operation with a timeout (e.g., use the timeout command or a similar mechanism) and check its exit status, retry or fail with a clear error message and non-zero exit code so the script doesn't block forever.



============================================================================
File: setup-new-repo.sh
Line: 62 to 63
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In setup-new-repo.sh around lines 62 to 63, the script currently hardcodes the DROID_INSTALLER_SHA256 value when creating the repo Actions variable; change it to read the SHA from an environment variable (e.g., DROID_INSTALLER_SHA256 loaded from .env or previously exported) and use that variable in the gh api call instead of the literal hash. If the variable is not set, fail early with a clear error message or compute/populate it before the gh call to preserve existing behavior.



============================================================================
File: template-repo/.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml
Line: 283
Type: nitpick

Prompt for AI Agent:
In template-repo/.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml around line 283, the script uses process substitution  "${output}.tmp", and ensure you remove the temporary file afterward (or register a trap to clean it up on exit) to preserve portability and avoid relying on process substitution.



============================================================================
File: setup-new-repo.sh
Line: 55 to 56
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In setup-new-repo.sh around lines 55 to 56, the git push call can hang indefinitely; wrap the push in a timeout (e.g., use the timeout utility or equivalent) so the command is forcibly terminated after a sensible duration (choose a duration consistent with the clone timeout used elsewhere), propagate the non-zero exit code if timeout occurs, and update any error handling/log message to indicate the push timed out.



============================================================================
File: auto-setup-all.sh
Line: 30 to 31
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In auto-setup-all.sh around lines 30 to 31, the curl call lacks any timeout and can hang indefinitely; update the curl invocation to include sensible timeouts (for example --connect-timeout 10 and --max-time 30) so the command will fail fast on network stalls and won’t block the script, and keep existing flags (-fsSL --compressed) intact; adjust values as needed for your environment.



============================================================================
File: .github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml
Line: 38 to 42
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml lines 38 to 42: the checkout step references steps.pr-details.outputs.head_sha which does not exist; either remove that fallback reference and use github.event.pull_request.head.sha only, or add a prior pr-details step that queries the GitHub API (or uses actions/github-script) to set outputs.head_sha when the workflow is triggered via workflow_dispatch. If you choose to add the step, place it before the checkout step, ensure it runs for non-PR triggers, sets outputs.head_sha correctly, and update the checkout ref to use the existing PR SHA or the newly created pr-details output.



============================================================================
File: .github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml
Line: 54 to 62
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In .github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml around lines 54 to 62 the curl invocation that downloads the Droid CLI has no timeout and can hang indefinitely; update the curl command to include explicit timeouts (for example add --connect-timeout 10 and --max-time 60 while keeping the existing -fsSL flags) so the workflow fails fast on stalled networks and doesn't hang indefinitely.



============================================================================
File: .github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml
Line: 85 to 90
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml around lines 85 to 90: the test step currently uses the unsafe flag --skip-permissions-unsafe; remove that flag from the production workflow and either (a) delete the flag from this step entirely, or (b) move this test into a separate optional job gated by a repository secret or workflow_dispatch input (so it only runs intentionally), and if the flag is truly required, add an inline comment documenting why and implement proper permission handling (explicitly grant only needed permissions or use a temporary test-only credential) before reintroducing it.



============================================================================
File: gh-alias-setup.md
Line: 19 to 31
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In gh-alias-setup.md around lines 19 to 31, the one-liner contains hardcoded secret values on lines 24 and 76; remove those literal API keys and replace them with environment-variable references or clear placeholders (e.g. use $FACTORY_API_KEY, $MODEL_API_KEY, $DROID_INSTALLER_SHA256 or  placeholders) so the alias reads values from the caller's environment, update the surrounding text to instruct users to export those three env vars beforehand, and add a note to rotate and revoke the exposed keys immediately and confirm no other docs/history contain them.



============================================================================
File: auto-setup-all.sh
Line: 34 to 93
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In auto-setup-all.sh around lines 34 to 93, the git clone can hang (no timeout), errors are being suppressed rather than surfaced, and rm -rf is run on an unchecked path; update the function to use a bounded clone (e.g., use the timeout command and shallow clone: timeout s git clone --depth 1 "https://github.com/$repo.git" "$temp_dir"), capture and check the exit status of clone/push/gh commands and print a descriptive error message (including stderr) when they fail instead of swallowing errors with 2>/dev/null || true, and before running rm -rf validate that $temp_dir is non-empty and points under /tmp or $(mktemp -d) pattern (or test -d "$temp_dir") to avoid deleting unintended paths; also ensure to cd back only if the temporary dir was successfully created and tracked.



============================================================================
File: test-code-review.js
Line: 52 to 58
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In test-code-review.js around lines 52 to 58, the click event listener is attached without any cleanup which can leak if setupButton() is called repeatedly or the element is removed; fix it by making the handler a named function or create an AbortController and pass its signal to addEventListener, ensure you check button !== null before attaching, and return a cleanup function that either calls controller.abort() or calls button.removeEventListener with the same named handler so the listener can be removed when no longer needed.



============================================================================
File: test-code-review.js
Line: 45 to 49
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In test-code-review.js around lines 45 to 49, the SQL query is built via string concatenation (vulnerable to SQL injection); change it to use a parameterized/prepared query with bound parameters from the database client (do not inline userId into the SQL), and validate/coerce userId to the expected type (e.g., integer) before passing it to the parameter binder; ensure you call the database.query/execute with the SQL and a separate params object/array per your DB library so no raw user input is concatenated into the SQL string.



============================================================================
File: test-code-review.js
Line: 66 to 77
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In test-code-review.js around lines 66 to 77, the current async forEach callback does not wait for the fetch promises and causes the function to return before completion; replace the forEach block with either: (a) parallel resolution using const results = await Promise.all(promises) and return that, or (b) sequential resolution using a for...of loop that awaits each promise and pushes into results; update the function to await the chosen approach so it returns only after all fetches complete.



============================================================================
File: bulk-uninstall 2.sh
Line: 44 to 59
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In bulk-uninstall 2.sh around lines 44 to 59, the redirection order 2>&1 > /dev/null is incorrect so stderr is not suppressed; update the commands on lines 47, 56, and 57 to redirect both stdout and stderr correctly by using either > /dev/null 2>&1 or the shorthand &> /dev/null (keep the rest of the command intact), ensuring both standard output and error are silenced.



============================================================================
File: bulk-uninstall 2.sh
Line: 38 to 41
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In bulk-uninstall 2.sh around lines 38 to 41, the get_repos() function calls jq but there is no prerequisite check; update the existing check() function to verify jq is installed (e.g., use command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 or which jq) and if missing print a clear error message instructing the user to install jq and exit with a non-zero status; ensure the message uses the same color/format helpers as other checks and is executed before get_repos() is ever called.



============================================================================
File: test-code-review.js
Line: 32 to 42
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In test-code-review.js around lines 32 to 42, the while-loop can enter an infinite loop because the continue bypasses the i++ increment when items[i] === "skip"; to fix, ensure the index is always advanced — either move i++ to the top of the loop body (so it runs before any continue), increment i before each continue branch (add i++ immediately before the continue), or simplify by refactoring the function to use a for loop (for (let i=0; i<items.length; i++) { ... }) so the counter is reliably incremented.



============================================================================
File: uninstall-workflow 2.sh
Line: 204 to 216
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In uninstall-workflow 2.sh around lines 204 to 216, the get_repositories function calls jq but there is no prerequisite check; update the check_prerequisites() function to verify jq is installed (e.g., use command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1), and if missing print a clear error message and exit with a non-zero status so the script fails fast; keep message format consistent with other checks in the script and ensure any CI/logging helpers (log/print_status) are used as appropriate.



============================================================================
File: fix-workflow-issues.sh
Line: 1 to 20
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In fix-workflow-issues.sh around lines 1 to 20, the script currently assumes the GitHub CLI is present and authenticated; add prerequisite checks at the top to (1) verify the gh binary exists (exit non‑zero with a clear message if missing), and (2) verify the user is authenticated (use a lightweight gh command such as gh auth status or a harmless gh api call and exit with a descriptive error if it fails). Keep checks fast and non‑interactive so the script fails early with actionable messages when gh is not installed or not logged in.



============================================================================
File: test-code-review.js
Line: 25 to 29
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In test-code-review.js around lines 25 to 29, the async fetchData function has no error handling for network failures, non-OK HTTP statuses, or invalid JSON; wrap the fetch/response.json calls in a try/catch, check response.ok and throw a descriptive error (including status and url) for non-OK responses, handle or rethrow JSON parse errors with context, and ensure the function either returns a well-defined error object or throws so callers can handle failures gracefully.



============================================================================
File: test-code-review.js
Line: 61 to 63
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In test-code-review.js around lines 61 to 63, the function getLastElement uses arr[arr.length] which is out-of-bounds; change the access to arr[arr.length - 1] (or use arr.at(-1) for modern JS) so the function returns the actual last element.



============================================================================
File: test-code-review.js
Line: 3 to 22
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In test-code-review.js around lines 3 to 22, the function contains multiple issues: the DOM XSS code (lines ~19-21) is unreachable because of the early return on line ~15, there is a console.log after a return (unreachable), input uses == instead of ===, and there's no input validation/sanitization before assigning userInput to innerHTML. Fix by validating/sanitizing userInput at the top (reject or escape unsafe content), replace == with === for the "admin" check, remove or move the unreachable console.log so it executes before any return, and either move the DOM-manipulation code to a reachable location after sanitization or remove it entirely; if the unreachable XSS code is intentional test scaffolding, add a clear comment documenting that and ensure it cannot execute in production.



============================================================================
File: uninstall-workflow 2.sh
Line: 52 to 100
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In uninstall-workflow 2.sh around lines 52 to 100 (specifically lines 57, 76, and 86) the shell redirection order is wrong: 2>&1 > /dev/null does not send stderr to the same place as stdout; replace those with either > /dev/null 2>&1 or &> /dev/null so both stdout and stderr are suppressed. Update the three gh command invocations (gh variable delete ... and the two gh secret delete ... calls) to use the corrected redirection, keep the surrounding logic and return values unchanged, and run a quick local test to verify messages still display when commands fail.



============================================================================
File: uninstall-workflow 2.sh
Line: 273 to 321
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In uninstall-workflow 2.sh around lines 273-321, the selection parsing can append the same repository multiple times when ranges overlap; modify the function to deduplicate selected_repos before printing or instead prevent duplicates when adding: use an associative map (or temporary set) keyed by repo name or index to track additions and only append if not already present, then print the unique list in the original selection order (or sorted as desired).



============================================================================
File: fix-workflow-issues.sh
Line: 23 to 79
Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In fix-workflow-issues.sh around lines 23 to 79, the trap uses EXIT which only runs when the whole script exits so temp dirs pile up across looped repo updates; change the cleanup so it runs when the function returns by using a RETURN trap (e.g. trap 'rm -rf "$temp_dir"' RETURN) or explicitly remove the temp_dir before every return and at the end of the function, and clear the trap after cleanup to avoid removing the wrong directory later.
