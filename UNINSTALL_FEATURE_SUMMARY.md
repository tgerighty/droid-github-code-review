## What Gets Removed

When uninstalling, the following items are removed from each repository:

1. **Workflow File**
   - Path: `.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml`
   - Action: Deleted (or backed up to `.github/workflows/backup/` if `--backup` used)
   - Commit: "Remove Droid automated code review workflow"

2. **Repository Variable**
   - Name: `DROID_INSTALLER_SHA256`
   - Purpose: SHA256 checksum of Droid CLI installer
   - Action: Permanently deleted via GitHub API

3. **Repository Secrets**
   - `FACTORY_API_KEY`: Factory.ai API authentication
   - `MODEL_API_KEY`: Z.ai API authentication
   - Action: Permanently deleted via GitHub API

## Usage Examples

### Quick Uninstall (All Repositories)
```bash
./bulk-uninstall.sh
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Uninstall from all repos
./uninstall-workflow.sh

# Keep backup copies
./uninstall-workflow.sh --backup

# Specific repositories only
./uninstall-workflow.sh --repos "owner/repo1,owner/repo2"

# Interactive selection
./uninstall-workflow.sh --interactive

# Preview without changes
./uninstall-workflow.sh --dry-run
```

### Using Management Script
```bash
./manage-workflows.sh remove owner/repo1,owner/repo2
```

## Script Permissions

All scripts are now executable:
```bash
-rwxr-xr-x  bulk-install.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  bulk-uninstall.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  install-workflow.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  manage-workflows.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  quick-install.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  uninstall-workflow.sh
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Committing
1. ✅ Test dry-run mode: `./uninstall-workflow.sh --dry-run`
2. ✅ Test with single repo: `./uninstall-workflow.sh --repos "test/repo"`
3. ✅ Verify variable deletion: `gh variable list --repo test/repo`
4. ✅ Verify secret deletion: `gh secret list --repo test/repo`
5. ✅ Test backup mode: `./uninstall-workflow.sh --backup --repos "test/repo"`
6. ✅ Test interactive mode: `./uninstall-workflow.sh --interactive`

### After Installation
1. Install workflow on test repo: `./quick-install.sh --repos "test/repo"`
2. Verify installation: `./manage-workflows.sh check test/repo`
3. Uninstall: `./uninstall-workflow.sh --repos "test/repo"`
4. Verify removal: `./manage-workflows.sh check test/repo`

## Error Handling

The scripts handle common errors gracefully:

- **Missing workflow file**: Continues to remove secrets/variables
- **Missing secrets/variables**: Logs warning, continues processing
- **Clone failures**: Logs error, continues to next repository
- **Push failures**: Logs error, continues to next repository
- **API errors**: Logs warning, continues processing
- **Rate limits**: Automatic delays prevent hitting limits

## Logging

All uninstallation operations are logged to `workflow-uninstallation.log`:
- Timestamp for each operation
- Repository being processed
- Success/failure of each step
- Error messages with details
- Summary statistics

Example log entry:
```
2024-10-11 17:50:23 - Processing repository: owner/repo1
2024-10-11 17:50:25 - Removed workflow from owner/repo1
2024-10-11 17:50:26 - Removed DROID_INSTALLER_SHA256 variable from owner/repo1
2024-10-11 17:50:27 - Removed FACTORY_API_KEY secret from owner/repo1
2024-10-11 17:50:28 - Removed MODEL_API_KEY secret from owner/repo1
2024-10-11 17:50:28 - Completed processing owner/repo1
```

## Documentation

## Integration with Existing Tools

The uninstallation feature integrates seamlessly with existing tools:

1. **manage-workflows.sh**: Enhanced `remove` command now cleans up secrets/variables
2. **Consistent patterns**: Uses same structure as installation scripts
3. **Shared utilities**: Uses same color coding, logging, and error handling
4. **Compatible options**: Similar flags and arguments as installation scripts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- [ ] Bulk operations on organization-level secrets/variables
- [ ] Backup restoration capability
- [ ] Audit trail of removals
- [ ] Batch processing with parallelization
- [ ] JSON/CSV export of removal status
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Scheduled uninstallation

## Summary

This implementation provides a complete, user-friendly, and safe way to remove the Droid Code Review workflow from repositories. The feature includes:

- **2 new uninstallation scripts** (simple and advanced)
- **Enhanced management script** with proper cleanup
- **Comprehensive documentation** with examples
- **Safety features** to prevent accidental data loss
- **Proper error handling** and logging
- **Clean removal** of all workflow components

The uninstallation process mirrors the installation process in terms of user experience, making it intuitive for users who have already installed the workflow.
