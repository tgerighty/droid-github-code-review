## Quick Uninstall

The fastest way to remove the workflow from all your repositories:

```bash
./bulk-uninstall.sh
```

This script will:
1. Ask for confirmation before proceeding
2. Remove the workflow file from each repository
3. Delete all associated secrets and variables
4. Show you a summary of the results

## Advanced Uninstall

For more control over the uninstallation process, use the advanced script:

```bash
./uninstall-workflow.sh [OPTIONS]
```

### Available Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help message and exit |
| `-b, --backup` | Keep a backup copy of the workflow file in each repository |
| `-i, --interactive` | Select repositories interactively |
| `-r, --repos REPOS` | Comma-separated list of specific repositories to uninstall from |
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be removed without making changes |

## What Gets Removed

When you uninstall the workflow, the following items are removed from each repository:

### 1. Workflow File
- **Path**: `.github/workflows/droid-code-review.yaml`
- **Action**: Deleted (or backed up if using `--backup`)

### 2. Repository Variable
- **Name**: `DROID_INSTALLER_SHA256`
- **Purpose**: SHA256 checksum of the Droid CLI installer
- **Action**: Permanently deleted

### 3. Repository Secrets
- **Name**: `FACTORY_API_KEY`
- **Purpose**: Factory.ai API authentication
- **Action**: Permanently deleted

- **Name**: `MODEL_API_KEY`
- **Purpose**: Z.ai API authentication for GLM-4.6 model
- **Action**: Permanently deleted

## Uninstall Options

### Option 1: Remove from All Repositories

```bash
./bulk-uninstall.sh
```

**Use when**: You want to completely remove the workflow from all your repositories.

**What happens**:
- Scans all your repositories
- Removes workflow files
- Cleans up secrets and variables
- Shows progress and summary

### Option 2: Remove from Specific Repositories

```bash
./uninstall-workflow.sh --repos "owner/repo1,owner/repo2,owner/repo3"
```

**Use when**: You only want to remove the workflow from certain repositories.

**What happens**:
- Only processes the specified repositories
- Same cleanup as bulk uninstall
- Faster if you have many repositories

### Option 3: Interactive Selection

```bash
./uninstall-workflow.sh --interactive
```

**Use when**: You want to manually select which repositories to uninstall from.

**What happens**:
- Shows a numbered list of all your repositories
- You select which ones to uninstall from (e.g., "1,3,5-8")
- Processes only your selected repositories

### Option 4: Uninstall with Backup

```bash
./uninstall-workflow.sh --backup
```

**Use when**: You want to keep a copy of the workflow file for reference or future use.

**What happens**:
- Workflow file is copied to `.github/workflows/backup/droid-code-review.yaml`
- Original workflow file is removed
- Secrets and variables are still deleted
- Backup is committed to the repository

### Option 5: Dry Run (Preview Only)

```bash
./uninstall-workflow.sh --dry-run
```

**Use when**: You want to see what would be removed without actually making changes.

**What happens**:
- Shows list of repositories that would be processed
- Shows what would be removed from each repository
- No actual changes are made
- Safe to run anytime

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Removal from All Repos

```bash
# Quick and simple - removes everything
./bulk-uninstall.sh
```

**Output**:
```

## Using manage-workflows.sh

You can also use the management script to remove workflows:

```bash
# Remove from specific repositories
./manage-workflows.sh remove owner/repo1,owner/repo2
```

This provides the same functionality but integrates with other workflow management commands.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to clone repository"

**Cause**: Insufficient permissions or network issue.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify you have access to the repository
gh repo view owner/repo

# Check your authentication
gh auth status
```

### "Secret not found or already removed"

**Cause**: The secret may have been manually deleted already or never existed.

**Impact**: This is a warning, not an error. The script continues normally.

**Action**: No action needed - this is expected if secrets were already removed.

### "Variable not found or already removed"

**Cause**: The variable may have been manually deleted already or never existed.

**Impact**: This is a warning, not an error. The script continues normally.

**Action**: No action needed - this is expected if the variable was already removed.

### "Workflow not found"

**Cause**: The workflow file doesn't exist in the repository.

**Impact**: The script will still attempt to clean up secrets and variables.

**Action**: No action needed - the script will continue to clean up other resources.

### "Failed to push changes"

**Cause**: Insufficient permissions or branch protection rules.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if you have write access
gh api repos/owner/repo --jq '.permissions'

# Check branch protection rules
gh api repos/owner/repo/branches/main/protection
```

### Rate Limiting

If you have many repositories, you might hit GitHub API rate limits.

**Solution**: The scripts include automatic delays between operations. If you still hit limits:
```bash
# Check your rate limit status
gh api rate_limit

# Wait and try again later, or process fewer repositories at a time
./uninstall-workflow.sh --repos "repo1,repo2" # Process in batches
```

## Safety Features

All uninstallation scripts include safety features:

1. **Confirmation Prompt**: Always asks for explicit "yes" confirmation
2. **Warnings**: Clearly shows what will be removed
3. **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes without making them
4. **Error Handling**: Continues processing other repositories if one fails
5. **Detailed Logging**: All operations are logged to `workflow-uninstallation.log`
6. **Backup Option**: Can keep workflow file copies for reference
7. **Rate Limiting Protection**: Automatic delays between operations

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Dry Run**: Always run with `--dry-run` first to preview changes
2. **Keep Backups**: Use `--backup` flag if you might need the workflow configuration later
3. **Specific First**: Test with specific repositories before bulk operations
4. **Check Logs**: Review `workflow-uninstallation.log` for detailed information
5. **Verify Access**: Ensure you have admin access to all target repositories

## After Uninstallation

Once the workflow is removed:

1. ‚úÖ The workflow file is deleted from repositories
2. ‚úÖ No more automated code reviews will run
3. ‚úÖ Secrets and variables are permanently deleted
4. ‚úÖ No trace of the workflow remains (unless backup was kept)

### To Reinstall Later

If you want to reinstall the workflow:

```bash
# Use the installation scripts
./quick-install.sh

# Or for specific repositories
./install-workflow.sh --repos "owner/repo1,owner/repo2"
```

## Need Help?

- Check the main [README.md](README.md) for general information
- Review [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for installation issues
- Check the log files for detailed error messages
- Ensure GitHub CLI is properly authenticated: `gh auth status`
